# AngularFlickrInterface

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Dependencies

Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies. 

For speed of development:
* Bootstrap - grid
* ng-bootstrap - modal
* ngx-infinate-scroll - infinate scroll

## Note to reviewer

I'm a react dev, but I thought I'd give it a bash in angular and typescript seeing as that's what you guys use (first time for both). I managed to break the infinate scroll right at the end, not sure what I did but I'm out of time. If anything it was a good learing experience. 

## TODO

Given more time I'd fix the scroll, add better styling, add in some unit tests and make it a bit more accessible.
